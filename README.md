Some supplementary files for the hovlinc paper:

Yue Chen<sup>#</sup>, Fei Qi<sup>#</sup>\*, Fan Gao, Huifen Cao, Dongyang Xu, Kourosh Salehi-Ashtiani, and Philipp Kapranov\*. Hovlinc is a recently evolved class of ribozyme found in human lncRNA. ***Nat Chem Biol*** (2021). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41589-021-00763-0

## alignments

Multiple sequence alignments:

- `MSA_all_homologs.fa`: alignment of human hovlinc and 75 homologous sequences
- `MSA_hominins.fa`: alignment of the 3 active sequences from human, chimpanzee and bonobo

## descr

Descriptors of the RNA sequence-structure patterns of some known ribozyme classes. These descriptors were used as input to the *RNAMotif* program to check whether hovlinc ribozyme is an instance of these known ribozymes.

## script

R code for calculating the *k<sub>obs</sup>* and p*K<sub>a</sup>* of hovlinc ribozyme.
